It removes redundant data segments to compress data into a highly compact form and makes it economical to store backups on disk drive instead of tape drive. The technique identifies unique chunks of data, or byte patterns and stores them during the time of analysis. The chunks of new data are hashed and compared with the existing hashes of the other chunks to determine if there is a match. This project is aimed at creating a data deduplication file system which performs post-processing (lazy) analysis on the data stored into the file system

SMR values are also used as a psychoacoustic metric to determine the perceptual relevance of partials during analysis data postprocessing. The system's noise component is modeled using Bark-scale frequency warping and sub-band noise energy evaluation. Noise energy at the sub-bands is then distributed on a frame-by-frame basis among the partials resulting in a compact hybrid representation based on noise modulated sinusoidal trajectories.

We started with the work that was already done on an evaluation board based on STM32L1 platform (STEVAL-IKR001V1, http://www.st.com/web/en/catalog/tools/PF253893). The original project, called "Mist", was created by Thingsquare using Spirit1 radio transceiver (STEVAL-IKR001V8D, http://www.st.com/web/en/catalog/tools/FM116/SC1075/PF258319). We converted the system calls from the original platform to the target platform. We have adapted Spirit1 radio driver in order to work properly on STM32F4. Then, we created a Wireless Sensor Network and collected several communication and performance data.  I worked on it with Daniele Saitta.  To manage the entire work, we used IAR Embedded Workbench (http://www.iar.com/en/products/iar-embedded-workbench/arm/).
